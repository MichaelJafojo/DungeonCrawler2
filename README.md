## CS2340_Team23
This is a semester long project, me and my team created a recreation of the Dungeon Crawler Game!
The tech stack used is Android Studio.
After choosing your sprite and difficulty you move the player by pressing up, down, left, and right, in order to attack an enemy you press the space bar, and finally in order to pick up a power-up you press S!
Deafeating enemies increases your score, and your score will decrease the longer you take to finish. Hihgher difficulties gives you more points per enemy kill, but enemies do more damage. 
Get to the end of the game fast and by defeating as many enemies as you can in order to get a high score!
